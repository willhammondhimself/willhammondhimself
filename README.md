# Hi there, I'm Will Hammond! 👋

## About Me
I'm a second-year student at **Pitzer College** studying **Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics**. I'm passionate about applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems, particularly in financial technology, AI/ML, quantum computing, and algorithmic trading systems.

Currently exploring the intersection of physics, mathematics, and software development while building practical projects to deepen my understanding of these fields.
