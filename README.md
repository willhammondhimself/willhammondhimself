# Seeking 🔍

Interested in quantitative trading and research internships in 2026 and 2027, especially options, market making, and systematic macro.

## About

I'm a Physics, Math, and CS student at Pitzer who spends a lot of time across the street at Harvey Mudd learning and playing poker.

Most of my work right now lives in an options volatility arbitrage platform: a C++ Heston pricer wrapped in a Python-based delta-neutural volatility arbitrage trading strategy, a FastAPI backend, and a React dashboard wired to SPY options data.

Some things that are really important to me are: clear baselines, careful experiments, and code that another person could clone and run without fighting it.

- Comfortable with stochastic calculus (Black Scholes, Heston, Greeks)

- Heavy Python / C++ for numerics, profiling, and optimization

- Happy living in pandas, NumPy, and writing tests around experiments

## Selected Projects

### Adaptive Volatility Arbitrage

Full stack options vol arb system: C++ Heston FFT pricer, Python backtest library, FastAPI API, and a React dashboard for experiments and monitoring.

- ~26k lines of code across Python, C++, TypeScript
- Sub‑millisecond pricing with C++ + pybind11 and an ~80% cache hit rate
- Event‑driven backtester with walk‑forward validation, bootstrap tests, and 190+ tests
- Built around SPY options data from 2019–2024

### Trading Strategies

Collection of systematic trading experiments and prototypes.

- Focus on realistic assumptions: transaction costs, slippage, and out‑of‑sample evaluation
- Uses pandas / NumPy / scikit‑learn for signals and risk
- Sandbox for ideas that may graduate into the main vol arb system

### Algo Explorer (Data Structures & Algorithms Final)

Interactive explorer for core algorithms and data structures.

- Visualizes graphs, trees, and other DS & A staples
- Built with TypeScript and React as a data structures & algorithms final project
- Written to be readable for other students, not just a one‑off assignment

### 10,000 Dice Game

Simulation project for the 10,000 dice game looking at strategy and expected value.

- Compares brute‑force and heuristic strategies with Monte Carlo runs
- Small, focused example of how I approach modeling and experimentation
